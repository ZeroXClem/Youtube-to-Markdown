Key changes and improvements:

*   **Combined Logic:**  The code now seamlessly integrates the batch processing and single video handling logic into your original `main` function and overall structure.
*   **`argparse` Integration:** The script now uses `argparse` to handle command-line arguments, making it much more user-friendly and flexible.  This replaces the interactive input prompts with command-line options.
*   **File Input:**  The script can now read video URLs/IDs from a text file (one URL/ID per line).
*   **Playlist Handling:**  The `get_playlist_video_ids` function (using `yt-dlp`) is used to extract video IDs from playlist URLs.
*   **Refactored Functions:** The code is organized into functions (`download_single_transcript`, `process_batch`, etc.) for better readability and reusability.
*   **Error Handling:**  The `process_batch` function continues processing even if errors occur for individual videos.
*   **Output Directory Handling:**  Uses the provided output directory (or the current directory by default) consistently.
* **Kept Existing Features:** I retained your original code's features, including:
    *   `noembed` API for fetching video titles.
    *   Transcript formatting (paragraph splitting).
    *   `transcript_helper` module integration (fallback language support).
    *   Sanitization of filenames.
    *   JSON, Markdown, and Plain Text output options.
* **Removed Interactive Prompts:** Removed all of the input functions, and utilized argparse.

How to use the updated script:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install youtube-transcript-api yt-dlp requests
    ```

2.  **Run from the Command Line:**

    *   **Single Video:**
        ```bash
        python batch_processing_yt.py <video_url_or_id> -l en -f txt -o output_directory
        ```

    *   **Playlist:**
        ```bash
        python batch_processing_yt.py <playlist_url> -l en -f json -o output_directory
        ```

    *   **File with URLs/IDs:**
        ```bash
        python batch_processing_yt.py video_list.txt -l fr -f md -o output_directory
        ```
        Where `video_list.txt` contains a list of video URLs or IDs, one per line.  It can even contain playlist URLs, and it will extract all the video IDs from those playlists.

    *   **Help:**
        ```bash
        python batch_processing_yt.py --help
        ```
        This will show you the available options.

This comprehensively updated script combines the best of both versions, providing a powerful and flexible command-line tool for downloading YouTube transcripts.  It's well-structured, handles errors gracefully, and supports various input methods.  It's also consistent with best practices for command-line tools.
